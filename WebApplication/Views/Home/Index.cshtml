                    Academic support services assist students in achieving their academic goals and get support on topics or subjects they find difficult to understand. Bright Boost provides educational support to students after school. Bright Boost offers term-wise tutoring services where the student can attend any number of sessions in a week. Sessions are currently offered only on weekdays from 3:30 PM to 5:30 PM and students can attend any of these sessions to seek guidance on their queries.
